## üîÆ Future Scope

While the current implementation is robust, here are some features that could be added in the future:

  * **Enhanced Mentor Vetting:** Allow mentors to upload PDFs or images of their transcripts during application for admins to review.
  * **Availability Control:** Give mentors the ability to toggle their visibility in the "Find a Mentor" list, allowing them to stop accepting new students without losing contact with existing ones.
  * **Improved User Deletion Logic:** Implement a system where deleting a user account also removes their ID from their connected students' or mentors' lists.
  * **UI/UX Enhancements:** Add a footer and refine the landing page animations and layout for a more polished user experience.
